# Image-Encryption-with-AES-Block-Cipher-Modes-
This project is a Python script that demonstrates the principles of symmetric-key encryption by applying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to images. It showcases the key differences between various block cipher modes of operation, specifically ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and CTR.
